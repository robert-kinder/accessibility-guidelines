    <h3>Page structure</h3>

    <details>
        <summary>
            I use a screen reader. I need to understand what's on a page and use all the functionalities.
        </summary>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Please use well-nested headings (even if some of them are visually hidden) to organise all the content on the page.
            </li>

            <li>
                Please use tables, when the data can be organised as a table.
            </li>

            <li>

            </li>
        </ul>
    </details>

    <h3>Use of colour</h3>

    <details>
        <summary>
            I don't differentiate colours but I still need to understand what the page is saying and how to use it.
        </summary>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Please don't communicate information using just colour.
            </li>

            <li>
                If there are links in sentences or paragraphs, please show me where they are using more than just colour.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </details>

    <h3>Contrast</h3>

    <details>
        <summary>
            I struggle to read text when it doesn't have good contrast.
        </summary>

        <ul>
            <li>
                If text is big (24+ pixels or 18+ pixels and bold) please make sure there's at least 3:1 contrast.
            </li>

            <li>
                If text is not big, please give it a24+ pixels (or 18+ pixels and bold), please give it at least 4.5:1 contrast.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>
            I struggle to see interactive elements when they don't have a good contrast – or know what state they're in.
        </summary>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Please make sure that interactive element have a 3:1 contrast.
            </li>

            <li>
                When an interactive element is in a special state (e.g. focused, or in error) please make sure that whatever you use to indicate that status has 3:1 contrast.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </details>

    <h3>Text resizing</h3>
    
    <details>
        <summary>
            I need to increase the size of text to 200% so I can read it.
        </summary>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Please do not prevent me from using pinch and zoom on touch-screen devices.
            </li>

            <li>
                Relative units?
            </li>
        </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>
            I need to increase the space between lines, paragraphs, words and letters to help me read.
        </summary>

        <p>
            Some explanations.
        </p>

    </details>

    <h3>Responsive layout</h3>

    <details>
        <summary>
            I need to make the page way bigger, and still have access to everything. If I need to scroll both horizontally and vertically, that makes finding and noticing things on the page almost impossible.
        </summary>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Please make sure content will reflow to a single column when zoomed and not produce scrolling in both directions.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </details>
