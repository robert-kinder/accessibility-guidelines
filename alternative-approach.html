    <section> <h3>Contrast</h3>

        <details>
            <summary>
                I struggle to read text when it doesn't have good contrast.
            </summary>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    If text is big (24+ pixels or 18+ pixels and bold) please make sure there's at least 3:1 contrast.
                </li>

                <li>
                    If text is not big, please give it a24+ pixels (or 18+ pixels and bold), please give it at least 4.5:1 contrast.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>
                I struggle to see interactive elements when they don't have a good contrast – or know what state they're in.
            </summary>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Please make sure that interactive element have a 3:1 contrast.
                </li>

                <li>
                    When an interactive element is in a special state (e.g. focused, or in error) please make sure that whatever you use to indicate that status has 3:1 contrast.
                </li>

    <section> <h3>Use of colour</h3>
        <details>
            <summary>
                I don't differentiate colours but I still need to understand what the page is saying and how to use it.
            </summary>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Don't communicate information using just colour.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Don't use colour alone to identify data on infographics.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            If there are links in sentences or paragraphs, show me where they are using more than just colour.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            If I've made an error in a form, don't use colour alone (e.g. a red border) to show me where the error is.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

    <section> <h3>Page structure</h3>

        <details>
            <summary>
                I use a screen reader. I need to understand what's on a page and use all the functionalities.
            </summary>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Please use well-nested headings (even if some of them are visually hidden) to organise all the content on the page.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Please use tables, when the data can be organised as a table.
                </li>

                <li>

        <details>
            <summary>
                I need to increase the size of text to 200% so I can read it.
            </summary>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Please do not prevent me from using pinch and zoom on touch-screen devices.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Relative units?
                </li>
            </ul>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>
                I need to increase the space between lines, paragraphs, words and letters to help me read.
            </summary>

            <p>
                Some explanations.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Please do not give limit both the width and height of elements.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Please do not prevent me from overriding text styles.
                </li>

        </details>

    <section><h3>Responsive layout</h3>

        <details>
            <summary>
                I need to make the page way bigger, and still have access to everything. If I need to scroll both horizontally and vertically, that makes finding and noticing things on the page almost impossible.
            </summary>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Please make sure content will reflow to a single column when zoomed and not produce scrolling in both directions.
                </li>
            </ul>

    <h2>6. Language and instructions</h2>

    <section><h3>Instructions in forms</h3>
        <details>
            <summary>
                I need to understand (and remember) what information I'm supposed to put in a text field.
            </summary>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Make sure that all form inputs have a label that's associated in code.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Make sure that the visible labels don't disappear when information is entered.
                </li>
           </ul>
        </details>
    </section>

    <section><h3>Input errors in forms</h3>
        <details>
            <summary>
                I need to notice if I've made a mistake in a form.
            </summary>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Clearly describe each input error in text. (A red border is not enough).
                </li>

                <li>
                    Associate each error with the input that it relates to.
                </li>
           </ul>
        </details>
    </section>

    <section><h3>Inclusive instructions</h3>
        <details>
            <summary>
                I can't see the page's layout or colours, so instructions that use words like "the button above" or "the green tick" mean nothing to me.
            </summary>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Make sure that instructions don't rely on sensory characteristics of the interface.
                </li>
           </ul>
        </details>

    </section>

    <section><h3>Language in code</h3>
        <details>
            <summary>
                I need my screen reader to pronounce words correctly, otherwise I can't understand what it's saying.
            </summary>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Specify the language of the page using the <code>lang</code> attribute on the <code>html</code> element.
                </li>

                <li>
                    If the page includes words in a different language, specify that language using the <code>lang</code> attribute on the container element.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </details>
