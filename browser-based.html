                I struggle to see interactive elements when they don't have a good contrast – or know what state they're in.

                            Don't use colour alone to identify data on infographics.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            If there are links in sentences or paragraphs, show me where they are using more than just colour.

                        <li>
                            If I've made an error in a form, don't use colour alone (e.g. a red border) to show me where the error is.
                        </li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Please use well-nested headings (even if some of them are visually hidden) to organise all the content on the page.

                <li>
                    Please make sure content will reflow to a single column when zoomed and not produce scrolling in both directions.

                </li>

                <li>
                    Associate each error with the input that it relates to – both visually and in code.
